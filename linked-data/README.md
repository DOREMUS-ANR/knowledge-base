This folder contains the results of various data interlinking tasks within the DOREMUS project:

- The results of pairwise linking of the different DOREMUS databases (in the EDOAL alignment format). The detailed description of the linking strategies, results, errors and statistics is in the [infos-linking-2018-02-14.txt](infos-linking-2018-02-14.txt) document.
- The pivot graph file contains only the certain links while the v3 of the pivot graph contains all unique works (not linked during the linking process) plus all works with certain links (all links with threshold 1)
- **ethnies-BnF2RAMEAU**: alignment of ethnics/region related terms from the BIB records of the BNF to the RAMEAU controlled vocabulary.
- **foreseen-realised-concerts**: alignment of the foreseen concerts to the realised ones from the Philharmonie de Paris catalogue (euterpe and ALOES databases).
