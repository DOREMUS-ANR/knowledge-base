Vocabulary alignments
=====================

Storing expert-validated alignments of vocabularies in the knowledge base. 

The folders `mop` and `genre` contain the final versions of the alignments of mops and genres related vocabularies that have been manually validated and enriched by experts in those formats:
 - `edoal`:  EDOAL in rdf/xml
 - `rdf`:  SKOS in rdf/xml
 - `ttl`:  SKOS in text/ttl

Note that `genre\edoal` contains a manually created mapping between iaml and rameau.

The `validateWorkplace` folder contains the early versions of automatically produced and expert validated alignments.
